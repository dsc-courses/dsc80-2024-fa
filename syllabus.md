## About üßê

DSC 80 serves as a bridge between lower-division and upper-division data
science courses. In DSC 80, students will gain proficiency with the data
science life cycle and learn many of the fundamental principles and techniques
of data science spanning algorithms, statistics, machine learning,
visualization, and data systems.

After DSC 80, students will be prepared for data science internships and
interviews, will have the tools to create their own data science portfolios,
and will have the maturity necessary to succeed in upper-division machine
learning and statistics courses.

**Prerequisites:** DSC 30 and DSC 40A.

---

## Getting Started üíª

The course website, [dsc80.com](https://dsc80.com), will contain links to all
course content. There are also a few things you'll need to do to get set up.

### Websites

You'll need to make accounts on the following sites:

- **Ed:** We‚Äôll be using Ed as our course message and discussion board. More
  details are in the [Communication](#communication-) section below. If you
  didn‚Äôt already get an invitation to our Ed course, [sign up
  here][ed].

- **Gradescope:** You‚Äôll submit all assignments and exams to
  [Gradescope][gradescope]. This is where all of
  your grades will live as well. Most of the assignments will be coding
  assignments. Parts of these assignments will be manually graded, but most of
  them will be autograded. You should have received an email invitation for
  Gradescope, but if not please let us know as soon as possible (preferably via
  Ed).

- **GitHub:** Like in DSC 30, you'll _access_ all course content (lecture slides
  and assignments) by _pulling_ our course GitHub repository. [The link to the
  repo is here.][github] In most assignments, you won't need to _push_ anything
  to GitHub. However, you will need to push to GitHub as part of your Final
  Project, so you'll need to have an account by then.

Note that we will not be using Canvas for anything this quarter.

### Development Environment

As soon as you are able to, go follow the steps in the [Tech
Support](../tech_support) page of the course website to set up your development
environment for the course.

### Forms

Please fill out the [Welcome Survey][welcome-survey] to tell us a bit more about
yourself and tell us if you need an alternate exam.

---

## Communication üí¨

This quarter, we‚Äôll be using Ed as our course message board. You will be added
to Ed automatically; use the invite link in the section above if you weren't
added.

If you have a question about anything to do with the course ‚Äî if you‚Äôre stuck
on a problem, didn‚Äôt understand something from lecture, want clarification on
course logistics, or just have a general question about data science ‚Äî you can
make a post on Ed. We only ask that if your question includes some or all of an
answer (even if you‚Äôre not sure it‚Äôs right), please make your post private so
that others cannot see it. You can also post anonymously to other students if
you prefer.

Course staff will regularly check Ed and try to answer any questions that you
have. You‚Äôre also encouraged to answer questions asked by other students.
Explaining something is a great way to solidify your understanding of it!

**Please don‚Äôt email individual staff members, just make a private or public Ed
post instead.**

## Course Components üçé

### Lectures

Lectures will be held in-person on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 9:30-10:50AM
(A00) and 11:00AM-12:20PM (B00) in <a
href="https://map.concept3d.com/?id=1005#!m/237174">Peterson Hall</a> 103.
Lectures will be podcasted.

**New**{: .label .label-green } In the Welcome Survey at the start of the
quarter, you will have the option of opting into lecture attendance or opting
out. If you choose to opt in, lecture attendance will be worth 5% of your
overall grade. If you choose to opt out, attendance will be worth 0%, and your
midterm and final exam grade will each be worth 2.5% more. To receive lecture
attendance for a given week, you must attend and participate in the in-lecture
activities for both lectures that week. You will receive full credit for lecture
attendance for the quarter if you attend at least 8 weeks of lecture during the
10 week quarter.

Lecture notebooks will be your main resource in this class. You can access them,
along with all course materials, by pulling from the [course GitHub
repository][github]. We will also link HTML previews of each lecture notebook
from the course homepage; you can use these to annotate the lecture notebooks
with a tablet, if you'd like.

Supplementary readings (which are different from pre-lecture readings) will
primarily come from _Learning Data Science_, a textbook written
by Sam Lau. It can be found at [learningds.org](https://learningds.org). Some
readings will come from [notes.dsc80.com](https://notes.dsc80.com), a set of
notes that were originally written to supplement DSC 80. Supplementary readings
are not required, in that you won't be tested on anything that appears only in
the readings but not in lectures or assignments, but you should still complete
them to supplement your understanding!

### Discussions and Exam Prep

Discussions will be held in-person on Mondays 4:00-4:50PM in Peterson Hall 103
and Fridays 6:00-6:50PM in Peterson Hall 102. Discussion sections will be
podcasted.

**New**{: .label .label-green } In past offerings of DSC 80, students often
wished for more opportunities to practice the types of questions that will be
asked on the midterm and final exams. To address this, we will be using
discussions as **exam prep**. In the Welcome Survey at the start of the quarter,
you will have the option of opting into discussion or opting out. If you choose
to opt in, discussions will be worth 5% of your overall
grade. If you choose to opt out, discussion will be worth 0%, and your midterm
and final exam grade will each be worth 2.5% more.

In each discussion, the TA will prepare a worksheet of exam questions. You will
receive credit for discussion for a particular week if you attend the discussion
in person and complete the worksheet. Attending at least 8 discussions during
the 10-week quarter will earn full credit for discussion.

### Labs

There will be **9 lab assignments** due weekly throughout the quarter. Each lab
assignment will consist of a mixture of coding and free response questions.
Coding questions will ask you to fill in the body of a function. Public tests
are usually provided so that you can make sure that you\'re on the right track
(_similar to_ DSC 20). However, your submission's final score will use a private
autograder with hidden tests.

Each lab is worth the same amount, but the lowest lab will be dropped when
calculating your final score. Labs will usually be released on Wednesdays and due on
**Wednesdays at 11:59PM**.

You will access labs (and projects) by pulling the course GitHub repository.

### Projects

There will be **4 projects** due throughout the quarter. Like labs, projects
consist of coding and free response questions. As their name implies, however,
projects are more open-ended and allow you to simulate applying your data
science skills in practical situations. You can think of the projects as being
mini-take-home-exams that track your _practical_ skills throughout the quarter
(whereas the exams themselves test for conceptual understanding).

Projects are due bi-weekly. However, the week _before_ a project is due, there
will often be a _project checkpoint_. This checkpoint will ensure that you\'re
on-track to complete the project on time, and should (hopefully) be a source of
easy points.

The Final Project will be due during finals week and can be thought of as a
practical component of the Final Exam.

Note that, unlike labs, the lowest project score is not dropped. Projects and
project checkpoints will usually be due on **Fridays at 11:59PM**.

**Working in Pairs**

You may work together on projects (and projects only!) with a partner. If you
work with a partner, you are both required to actively contribute to all parts
of the project. You must both be working on the assignment at the same time
together, either physically or virtually on a Zoom call. You are encouraged to
follow the pair programming model, in which you work on just a single computer
and alternate who writes the code and who thinks about the problems at a high
level.

In particular, you **cannot** split up the project and each work on separate
parts independently.

If you work with a partner:

- Only one partner needs to submit the project on Gradescope; this partner
  should add the other partner to their submission.
- You must also submit the checkpoint together.
- You and your partner will receive the same score on any submissions you make
  together.

If you are unhappy with your partnership (e.g., if your partner does not keep
in touch, does not come prepared to work on the assignment, or does not seem to
be engaged in the process), please first address your concerns to your partner,
and try to agree on what should be done to make the partnership work well for
both of you. If that approach is not successful, explain the issues to the
instructors, who will work with you and your partner to improve the situation.

You may use different partners on different projects.

**Note that you may not work with partners on lab assignments, however you're
encouraged to discuss all assignments with others at a conceptual level in
office hours and study groups.**

### Office Hours

To get help on assignments and concepts, course staff will be hosting several
office hours per week. All office hours will be held in person. See the
[Calendar](../calendar) tab of the course website for the most up-to-date
schedule and instructions.

### Weekly Schedule

To summarize all of the events and deadlines, refer to this general weekly
schedule (which is subject to change in any given week):

| Sunday | Monday     | Tuesday | Wednesday                                     | Thursday | Friday                                            | Saturday |
| ------ | ---------- | ------- | --------------------------------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------- | -------- |

## Exams üìù

This class has one Midterm Exam and one Final Exam. Exams are cumulative,
though the Final Exam will emphasize material after the Midterm Exam.

- **Midterm Exam**: Thursday, May 2nd, 9:30-10:50PM and 11:00AM-12:20PM in
  Peterson 103 (during lecture)

- **Final Exam:** Saturday, June 8th, 8AM-11AM. Location is TBD.

**Both exams will be administered in-person**. If you have conflicts with either
of the exams, please let us know on the [Exam Accommodations
Form][exam-accommodations].

### Redemption Policy

The Final Exam will consist of two parts: a ‚ÄúMidterm‚Äù section and a
‚Äúpost-Midterm‚Äù section. If you do better on the ‚ÄúMidterm‚Äù section of the Final
Exam than you did on the original Midterm Exam, your score on the ‚ÄúMidterm‚Äù
section will replace your original Midterm Exam score. This lowers the stakes
of the Midterm Exam and gives you two opportunities to demonstrate your
understanding of the content from the first half of the course. This also means
that you can miss the Midterm Exam for any reason and have the score be
replaced by your score on the ‚ÄúMidterm‚Äù section of the Final Exam (though we do
not recommend this).

**You must take the Final Exam to pass the course.**

## Policies üíØ

### Grading

Here is how we'll compute your grade:

| Component           | Weight | Notes                                                                      |
| ------------------- | ------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Labs                | 20%    | 2.5% per lab, lowest dropped                                               |
| Projects            | 25%    | 5% each for Projects 1-3, 10% for Project 4                                |
| Project Checkpoints | 5%     | 1% each                                                                    |
| Midterm Exam        | 20%    | see the Redemption Policy above                                            |
| Final Exam          | 30%    |                                                                            |
| Lecture Attendance  | 0%     | If opted in, counts as 5% and reduces Midterm and Final Exam by 2.5% each. |
| Discussion          | 0%     | If opted in, counts as 5% and reduces Midterm and Final Exam by 2.5% each. |

### Late Policy

All assignments must be submitted by 11:59PM San Diego time on the due date to
be considered on time. You may turn them in as many times as you like before the
deadline and only the most recent submission will count, so it‚Äôs a good habit
to submit early and often.

**New**{: .label .label-green } We recognize that life is unpredictable, and
that there are circumstances and emergencies that cannot be resolved
immediately. To account for this, you may request an extension for labs and
projects by filling out the [Extension Request Form][extension-request-form].
Filling out this form will grant you a 2-day deadline extension for an
assignment with no grade penalty. (We would like this process to be automatic,
but for now it requires a staff member to manually update your due date on
Gradescope.) We are using this policy instead of slip days this quarter to help
identify and support students who may be encountering difficult circumstances,
so if we notice that you have used the form many times during the quarter,
course staff will schedule a meeting with you to come up with a plan for
completing the rest of the course before approving further extension requests.

**If you submit an assignment late and didn't fill out the Extension Request
Form before the assignment deadline, the submission will not be accepted and you
will receive a 0.**

Note that we will not grant deadline extensions for the Final Project deadline
of June 8.

### Redemption Policy for Labs and Projects

**New**{: .label .label-green } Labs 1-9 and Projects 1-3 have a redemption
policy to make up for lost points on your original submission. After the
original deadline passes for an assignment, we will publish the autograder
result for your latest submission before the assignment deadline. You may then
submit the assignment as many times as you'd like before the final exam to
redeem up to 80% of the points you lost on the original submission.

Example: Suppose that after grades were released for the Project 1 deadline, Sam
receives a 90% since he lost points on a few hidden tests. He fixes the bugs,
resubmits, and his new submission gets a 100%. His final grade for Project 1
would then be 98% (0.8 \* (100% - 90%) + 90% = 98%).

Note that this redemption policy does not apply to project checkpoints, or the
Final Project.

<!--
You have **7 "slip days"** (up from 6) to use throughout the quarter. A slip day extends
the deadline of an assignment by 24 hours. The number of slip days you can use
on an assignment depends on the kind of assignment:

- On labs, you may use up to 1 slip day. Labs will not be accepted more than 24
  hours after the deadline. Note that you will not be able to use slip days on Labs 1 and 6, but their deadlines will be extended.
- On projects and project checkpoints, you may use up to 2 slip days. These
  assignments will not be accepted more than 48 hours after the deadline. Note
  that you will not be able to use slip days on Project 4 (which is due on Thursday, March 21st, no exceptions). -->

<!-- Slip days are designed to be a transparent and predictable source of leniency
in deadlines. You can use a slip day if you are too busy to complete an
assignment on its original due date (or if you forgot about it). But slip days
are also meant for things like the internet going down at 11:58PM just as you
go to submit your assignment. Slip days are meant to be used in exceptional
circumstances, so **you probably should not need to use all 6, but if you have
something going on in your life that is impeding your ability to do your
classwork on time, please reach out to us as soon as possible so we can work
something out**.

**Slip days are applied automatically at the end of the quarter, and you don‚Äôt
need to ask in order to use one.** It‚Äôs your responsibility to keep track of
how many you have left. If you‚Äôve run out of slip days and submit an assignment
late, that assignment may still be graded, but you will receive a 0 on it when
we calculate grades at the end of the quarter. However, in the event that you
use all 6 days and submit another assignment late, we will allocate your slip
days first to your projects (in chronological order), then to your labs (in
chronological order), and then to other assignments. This is done to prevent
you from receiving a 0 on, say, Project 3, if you've used all of your slip days
on labs up until that point; in such a case, you‚Äôd instead receive a 0 on an
earlier lab that isn‚Äôt weighted as much in your grade. -->

### Regrade Requests

Most of the labs and projects are autograded, but some questions are manually
graded. If you feel that there in an error in the autograder or that the manual
grader has made a mistake, you may submit a regrade request within **two
days** of the grades being released. If you do not submit a regrade request
within two days, your original grade will be final.

**Regrade Requests for Manually Graded Problems**

To submit a regrade request for a manually graded problem, make the regrade
request directly on Gradescope. Note that part of your grade is clarity, so if
your answer was mostly right but unclear you may still not be eligible for full
credit.

**Regrade Requests for Autograded Problems**

The autograder is very picky: it expects your assignments to have exactly the
correct file names, all functions must be named correctly, etc. If these are
wrong, your code may not run and the autograder may assign zero points. This is
a **grading catastrophe üòß**.

Grading catastrophes are preventable! After submitting your assignment, always
wait around to see the output of the Gradescope grader and ensure that it runs
properly. Also, be sure to submit your assignment (or at least part of it) to
Gradescope with enough time before the deadline to get help if there is a
strange autograder problem.

<!-- In the case that you submit code that doesn't run and discover this at a later
date, you have some options:

1.  If it is still before the late deadline, you may use slip days to fix your
    code and re-submit. Note that you're free to do this even if your code runs
    ‚Äì this is just making use of the normal slip day mechanism to submit an
    assignment late.
2.  If it is past the late deadline **and** your code requires only minor fixes
    (e.g., the file name is wrong) we will fix your code at the cost of **2**
    slip days. Note that these slip days are in addition to any slip days you
    already used on the assignment. You can submit a catastrophe regrade
    request the same way you submit a regular autograder regrade request, by
    filling out the [Autograder Regrade Request
    Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdQKoCJPxw2i3Dtn-ITZ_fkY3Rb46Pic6HyrDG6sgmXJnvc5w/viewform). -->

### Incompletes

In the unfortunate circumstance that you become sick, suffer a loss, or
otherwise experience a significant setback that is outside of your control, you
may be eligible for an Incomplete grade, which allows you to complete the rest
of the work at a later time. If you are experiencing challenges due to
circumstances outside your control, please contact me ASAP and we can discuss
the best course of action. Note that an Incomplete does not allow you to re-do
work that has already been completed, only to do work that hasn‚Äôt been
completed, so it‚Äôs best to reach out right away.

### A note on letter grades

_The following is adapted from [CSE
160](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse160/20au/syllabus/index.html#curve)
at the University of Washington._

Grading for this class is not curved in the sense that the average is set at
(say) a B+ and half of the class must receive a grade lower than that. If
everyone does well and shows mastery of the material, everyone can receive an A
(this would be awesome!). If no one does well (this is unlikely), then everyone
can receive a C.

Grading for this class is curved in the sense that we do not have a pre-defined
mapping from project and exam scores to a final GPA. There is no pre-determined
score (e.g., 90% of all possible points) that earns an A or a B or a C or any
other grade. To determine the final grade, we will ask questions like ‚ÄúDid this
student master the material?‚Äù. With that said, grades will not be any stricter
than the standard grading scale (where an A+ is a 97+, A is 93+, A- is 90+,
etc). For instance, the threshold for an ‚ÄúA‚Äù will never be higher than 93%.

Try your best not to worry about grades, and we‚Äôll reciprocate by being fair.
We‚Äôre in this together üòé.

## Collaboration Policy and Academic Integrity ü§ù

DSC 80 is known for being a rigorous but rewarding course. While you will be
challenged this quarter, we will be offering you plenty of support through
office hours and Ed. Make good use of these resources, and you will be able to
succeed in this course.

There is no excuse for cheating in this course. If you do cheat, we will
enforce the [UCSD Policy on Integrity of
Scholarship](https://senate.ucsd.edu/Operating-Procedures/Senate-Manual/Appendices/2).
This means you will likely fail the course and the Dean of your college will
put you on probation or suspend or dismiss you from UCSD. Students agree that
by taking this course, their assignments may be submitted to third-party
software to help detect plagiarism.

### Why is academic integrity important?

Academic integrity is an issue that is pertinent to all students on campus.
When students act unethically by copying someone‚Äôs work, taking an exam for
someone else, plagiarizing, etc., these students are misrepresenting their
academic abilities. This makes it impossible for instructors to give grades
(and for the University to give degrees) that reflect student knowledge. This
devalues the worth of a UCSD degree for all students, making it imperative for
the the campus as a whole to enforce that all members of this community are
honest and ethical. We want your degree to be meaningful and we want you to be
proud to call yourself a graduate of UCSD!

The UCSD Policy on Integrity of Scholarship and this syllabus list some of the
standards by which you are expected to complete your academic work, but your
good ethical judgment (or asking us for advice) is also expected as we cannot
list every behavior that is unethical or not in the spirit of academic
integrity. Ignorance of the rules will not excuse you from any violations.

### What counts as cheating?

In DSC 80, you can read books, surf the web, talk to your friends and the DSC
80 staff to get help understanding the concepts you need to know to complete
your assignments. However, all code must be written by you (or, in the instance
of projects, together with your partner).

The following activities are considered cheating and are not allowed in DSC 80
(not an exhaustive list):

- Using or submitting code acquired from other students (except from your pair
  programming partner during projects), the web, or any other resource not
  officially sanctioned by this course
- Posting your code online, including on Ed, unless privately to instructors
  only
- Having any other person complete any part of your assignment on your behalf
- Completing an assignment on behalf of someone else
- Providing code, exam questions, or solutions to any other student in the
  course
- Splitting up project questions with your pair programming partner and each
  working on different questions
- Collaborating with others on exams

The following activities are examples of appropriate collaboration and are
allowed in DSC 80 (not an exhaustive list):

- Discussing the general approach to solving labs or projects
- Talking about problem-solving strategies or issues you ran into and how you
  solved them
- Discussing the answers to exams with other students who have already taken
  the exam after the exam is complete
- Using code provided in class, by the textbook or any other assigned reading
  or video, with attribution
- Google searching for documentation on Python or `pandas`
- Working together with other students on assignments without copying or
  sharing answers
- Posting a question about your approach to a problem on Ed, without sharing
  your code

The best way to avoid problems is by using your best judgement and remembering
to act with Honesty, Trust, Fairness, Respect, Responsibility, and Courage.
Here are some suggestions for completing your work:

- Don't look at or discuss the details of another student's code for an
  assignment you are working on, and don't let another student look at your
  code.
- Don't start with someone else's code and make changes to it, or in any way
  share code with other students.
- If you are talking to another student about an assignment, don't take notes,
  and wait an hour afterward before you write any code.

### Use of Generative Artificial Intelligence

Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) describes tools, such as
[ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com) and GitHub Copilot, that are trained to
generate responses to user-defined prompts, or questions. The existence of such
tools is a major milestone in machine learning, and an impressive application of
data science in the real world.

Our course policy on the use of GenAI tools for coursework is simple: **you may
use these tools to build an understanding of course material and to assist you
on assignments, keeping in mind that no tool is a substitute for a strong
understanding of course concepts.**

Be mindful of how you are using GenAI tools. These tools can be very useful to
help you preview material before lecture, summarize material after lecture,
explain concepts you didn‚Äôt understand, and explore how different concepts are
related. ‚ÄúExplain it like I‚Äôm five‚Äù can be a helpful prompt to give you a basic
understanding of new concepts before being exposed to them in lecture.
Consolidating your knowledge after learning something new and relating it to
other things you know is important for learning and retention.

Unfortunately, GenAI tools are not a consistently reliable source of quality
information. Because of how GenAI tools are trained, they often provide answers
and write code that _look_ correct, but aren't actually correct. A goal of your
education is to develop an ability to identify and produce information that
actually is correct and doesn‚Äôt just sound correct. Human supervision of GenAI
tools is always necessary.

Proceed with caution when using tools to assist you with your assignments. DSC
80 is a foundational class for your study of data science; you need to master
the skills and concepts of this course if you want to use data science
effectively. Through exams, you will be tested on your independent ability to
apply course material to novel problems. Labs and projects are meant to prepare
you for these assessments, so overreliance on GenAI for assignments will rob you
of opportunities to learn and make it hard for you to perform well on exams.

If you do use GenAI to assist you on assignments, keep these guidelines in mind:

- **Design your prompts carefully.** Don‚Äôt just ask one question; ask a
  follow-up question based on the output to the first. To use these tools
  effectively, you need to engineer your prompts carefully.
- **Test the outputs.** GenAI tools can and do make mistakes, and being able to
  verify the correctness of a proposed answer is an important skill for you to
  develop. Validate the output against course-provided references, or follow up
  with a search on Google or Stack Overflow. Remember that GenAI tools provide
  crowdsourced likely answers, not necessarily correct answers.
- **Don‚Äôt submit any code that you don‚Äôt understand, or that uses content not
  taught in this class.** In our experience last quarter, students who used
  ChatGPT to help with assignments ended up with code that was difficult for
  both them and the teaching staff to understand. If you answer questions with
  out-of-scope content, you are not practicing the foundational skills that the
  course is meant to teach you. Be careful!

If your assignment submission includes any content generated by an AI tool, it
should be cited to acknowledge the source of the material. In each assignment,
you will be provided with a space to explain and reflect on your use of GenAI
tool(s).

### Accommodations

From the [Office for Students with Disabilities (OSD)](https://osd.ucsd.edu/):

> OSD works with students with documented disabilities to review documentation
> and determine reasonable accommodations. Disabilities can occur in these
> areas: psychological, psychiatric, learning, attention, chronic health,
> physical, vision, hearing, and acquired brain injuries, and may occur at any
> time during a student‚Äôs college career. We encourage you to contact the OSD
> as soon as you become aware of a condition that is disabling so that we can
> work with you.

If you already have accommodations via OSD, please make sure that we receive
your Authorization for Accommodation (AFA) letter by the end of Week 1 so that
we can make arrangements for accommodations. Share your AFA letter with the
instructor and the Data Science OSD Liaison, who can be reached at
dscstudent@ucsd.edu.

### Diversity and Inclusion

We are committed to an inclusive learning environment that respects our
diversity of perspectives, experiences, and identities. Our goal is to create a
diverse and inclusive learning environment where all students feel comfortable
and can thrive. If you have any suggestions as to how we could create a more
inclusive setting, please let us know. We also expect that you, as a student in
this course, will honor and respect your classmates, abiding by the [UCSD
Principles of
Community](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fucsd.edu%2Fabout%2Fprinciples.html&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNE1YPiUyffLg0kI10zLtUQl6iCDmQ).
Please understand that others‚Äô backgrounds, perspectives and experiences may be
different than your own, and help us to build an environment where everyone is
respected and feels comfortable.
